<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Version 3, 29 June 2007<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br />
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br />
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br />
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br />
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 0. Additional Definitions. <br />
<br />
&nbsp; As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br />
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br />
General Public License.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br />
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br />
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br />
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br />
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br />
Application with the Library.&nbsp; The particular version of the Library<br />
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br />
Version".<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br />
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br />
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br />
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br />
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br />
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br />
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br />
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br />
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br />
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br />
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br />
version:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; this License applicable to that copy.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br />
a header file that is part of the Library.&nbsp; You may convey such object<br />
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br />
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br />
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br />
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 4. Combined Works.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br />
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br />
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br />
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br />
the following:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Do one of the following:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 5. Combined Libraries.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br />
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br />
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br />
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br />
choice, if you do both of the following:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyed under the terms of this License.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br />
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br />
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br />
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br />
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br />
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br />
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br />
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br />
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br />
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br />
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br />
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br />
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br />
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br />
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br />
Library.<br />
