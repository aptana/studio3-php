/**
 * A simple description of a bit of text (technically, a bit of a text buffer)
 * that has a "type" associated with it. For example, for the XML text
 * "&LT;IMG&GT;", the ' <' might form a region of type "open bracket" where as
 * the text "IMG" might form a region of type "tag name".
 * 
 * Note that there are three positions associated with a region, the start,
 * the end, and the end of the text. The end of the region should always be
 * greater than or equal to the end of the text, because the end of the text
 * simply includes any white space that might follow the non-whitespace
 * portion of the region. This whitespace is assumed to be ignorable except
 * for reasons of maintaining it in the original document for formatting,
 * appearance, etc.
 * 
 * Follows the Prime Directives:
 * 
 * getEnd() == getStart() + getLength()
 * 
 * getTextEnd() == getStart() + getTextLength();
 * 
 * Event though 'end' and 'length' are redundant (given start), both methods
 * are provided, since some parsers/implementations favor one or the other for
 * efficiency.
