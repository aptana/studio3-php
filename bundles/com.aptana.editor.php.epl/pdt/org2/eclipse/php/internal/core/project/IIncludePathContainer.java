/**
 * Interface of a include path container. A include path container provides a way to indirectly reference a set of
 * include path entries through a include path entry of kind <code>CPE_CONTAINER</code>. Typically, a include path
 * container can be used to describe a complex library composed of multiple JARs or projects, considering also that
 * containers can map to different set of entries on each project, in other words, several projects can reference the
 * same generic container path, but have each of them actually bound to a different container object.
 * <p>
 * The set of entries associated with a include path container may contain any of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>library entries (<code>CPE_LIBRARY</code>)</li>
 * <li>project entries (<code>CPE_PROJECT</code>)</li>
 * </ul>
 * In particular, a include path container can neither reference further include path containers or include path
 * variables.
 * <p>
 * IncludePath container values are persisted locally to the workspace, but are not preserved from a session to another.
 * It is thus highly recommended to register a <code>IncludePathContainerInitializer</code> for each referenced
 * container (through the extension point "org.eclipse.jdt.core.IncludePathContainerInitializer").
 * <p>
