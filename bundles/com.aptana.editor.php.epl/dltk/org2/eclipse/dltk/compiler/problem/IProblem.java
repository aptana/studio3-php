/**
 * Description of a problem, as detected by the compiler or some of the
 * underlying technology reusing the compiler. A problem provides access to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>its location (originating source file name, source position, line
 * number),</li>
 * <li>its message description and a predicate to check its severity (warning
 * or error).</li>
 * <li>its ID : a number identifying the very nature of this problem. All
 * possible IDs are listed as constants on this interface.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Note: the compiler produces IProblems internally, which are turned into
 * markers by the ScriptBuilder so as to persist problem descriptions. This
 * explains why there is no API allowing to reach IProblem detected when
 * compiling. However, the problem markers carry equivalent information to
 * IProblem, in particular their ID (attribute "id") is set to one of the IDs
 * defined on this interface.
